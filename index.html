<h2>Day to day in my life</h2>
<p>I will usually go to auction house to thrift or get good deals on my fevorite items. I am lucky because Paris has an amazing auction house called Drouot.</p>
<h2>Favorite thing I Thrifted</h2>
<p>Usually I will look for Mid Century Modern furniture and try to flip them online. My luckyest find was 12 Herman Miller Eames DCM chairs that I paid $10.50 for EACH!!</p>
<h2>Why Mid Century Modern?</h2>
<p>I've always enjoyed the stylistic freedom designers had in the 1950's. We truly will never have another time in our future, where money was not an issue for companies to produce and design an object sold to the public. Through this core value of functionality we see in the last 20-30 years I sometimes think how amazing even the most simplest objects could be made.</p>
